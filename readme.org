Page View for Org Mode  
  

* Overview   
This is a package meant to emulate the visual, page-based layout of a word
processor like LibreOffice Write or Microsoft Word in org-mode. Mainly, it
divides your document into pages, divided by a visual pagebreak/footer,
implemented as an overlay. It currently applies styling and page sizes
that approximate a letter-sized page using Times New Roman 12 point, at 1.5
spacing. The package is built to work on top of [[https://github.com/rnkn/olivetti][olivetti-mode]], but it should
be able to function without it with minimal changes.

Note that the purpose of the package is to look like a word processor for more comfortable writing, not to be a perfect layout engine for documents. Org-mode remains the underlying format, so for publication or printing, use org-export to LaTeX, odt, html, or some other format.

* Installation  
  Clone or copy the file into your load path:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp  
(require 'page-view)  
#+end_src

  

* Usage  
  Activate the mode in an Org buffer:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp  
(page-view-mode)  
#+end_src

To toggle debugging overlays:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp  
(page-view-debug-mode)  
#+end_src


* Incremental Updates  
A small cache-invalidating mechanism ensures that only affected lines are recomputed after edits.  
Pagination updates occur:

- during jit-lock redisplay,
  
- after buffer changes,
  
- and during window scrolling.
  

* Configuration  
You can override or advise the function =page-view-setup= to change font parameters; if you're using olivetti-mode, =olivetti-body-width= determines the character width of the page; =page-view-lines-per-page= determines the size of a page.
  
Future versions aim to make these parameters fully customizable.

** Known Limitations

- Reflow while typing is functional but still rough in some cases 
  
- Tested primarily with Org Mode and =olivetti-mode=.
